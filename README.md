# Pong Game

This basic pong game built using SVGs, emulates the struggle that is outdoor tennis. In this version, the court is extended, balls sped up, and raquets rounded and decreased in size, just to make it a bit more challenging. May the calming park ambience soothe your headache.

## Takeaways
Having a reputation for being a little too loose at times, Javascript, as demonstrated in this project, exhibits the power to provide structure while maintaining flexibility. While this is my first experience with Object Oriented Programming, I am astounded to learn just how limitless, versatile, and formidable Javascript can be.
